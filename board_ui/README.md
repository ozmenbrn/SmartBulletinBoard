# Smart Bulletin Board UI

This project was created by start-react-app. We used:

* React Websocket: We used this component to listen to the websocket port we have opened from node-red on pi, which sent gpio messages to the socket.


* React-Images: We used this to prepare the slideshow effects with the pictures of the ads.
