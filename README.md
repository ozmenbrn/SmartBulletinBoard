Smart Bulletin Board is a connected bulletin board that will enable the students and the flier posters to interact with each other, enabling the customers to see the statistics about their advertisements and enabling students to apply for the job advertisements directly. Smart Bulletin Boards will be located in different building in campus and the advertisements will be seen according to where the boards are located in the campus based on the customers preferences.
