# Smart Bulletin Board UI

This project was created by start-react-app. We used:

* React Websocket: We used this component to listen to the websocket port we have opened from node-red on pi, which sent gpio messages to the socket.  
Special Thanks to : [React Websocket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-websocket)


* React-Images: We used this to prepare the slideshow effects with the pictures of the ads.
